# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-002: Authentication with Passport and JWT

### Status
**Accepted**

### Context
Authentication is a critical part of the application to ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources. The application needs a secure and scalable way to handle authentication for users, leveraging modern standards like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication. Additionally, the system requires flexibility for potential future integration with social logins or other authentication mechanisms.

### Decision
The authentication system will use **Passport.js** for strategy-based authentication and **JWT** for token-based stateless authentication. The following approach will be implemented:

1. **Local Strategy**: Used for username and password authentication during login.
2. **JWT Strategy**: Used to validate access tokens and secure protected endpoints.
3. **Refresh Token**: (Optional) Implemented to issue new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.
4. Passwords will be hashed using `bcrypt` to ensure secure storage.

### Consequences
#### ✅ Pros:
- **Modular and Extensible**: Passport provides a strategy-based system, allowing easy integration of additional strategies (e.g., social login).
- **Stateless Authentication**: JWT enables stateless APIs, reducing server-side complexity.
- **Secure**: Passwords are hashed, and sensitive data is not stored in the JWT payload.
- **Standards-Compliant**: JWT is widely adopted and supported by various libraries and tools.

#### ❌ Cons:
- **Token Revocation**: Stateless authentication lacks an inherent way to revoke tokens.
- **Increased Complexity**: Adding refresh tokens and managing token expiration adds complexity.
- **Security Risks**: Mismanagement of JWT (e.g., not securing the secret key or using insecure storage) can lead to vulnerabilities.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Session-Based Authentication**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Simpler to implement with session cookies.
     - Built-in token revocation when the session is invalidated.
   - **Cons**:
     - Does not work well with RESTful APIs and scaling across distributed systems.

2. **OAuth2**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Suitable for third-party authorization and delegated access.
   - **Cons**:
     - Overkill for simple user authentication.
     - Adds unnecessary complexity when the application does not need external integrations.

3. **Custom Token-Based Authentication**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Provides complete control over the authentication process.
   - **Cons**:
     - Reinvents the wheel; more prone to implementation bugs and security risks.
